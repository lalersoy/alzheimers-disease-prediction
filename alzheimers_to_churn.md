# How This Project Applies to User Churn Prediction

This project was originally developed to predict Alzheimer's diagnosis based on clinical, demographic, and behavioral data. While the subject matter is medical, the structure of the problem and the modeling approach are directly applicable to many real-world business cases: especially user churn prediction.

## Key Similarities

In both contexts, the goal is to:
- Predict a binary outcome (diagnosis or churn)
- Use individual-level data to assess risk
- Train and compare classification models
- Interpret which factors are most important for prediction
- Visualize results for decision-making

This is a common task in product analytics, where teams want to identify users who are likely to leave a service and understand what behaviors signal that risk.

## Mapping of Features 

| Alzheimerâ€™s Prediction Task   | Churn Prediction Analogy              |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Diagnosis (1) vs No Diagnosis (0) | Churn (1) vs Retained (0)         |
| Clinical test scores         | Engagement metrics (e.g. sessions, clicks) |
| Demographic/lifestyle data   | User segments, app usage patterns      |
| Feature importance analysis  | Churn driver analysis                  |
| SMOTE for imbalance          | Same technique often used in churn datasets |

## Why Itâ€™s Included in a Product Portfolio

While the domain is not product-related, the project demonstrates:
- Classification modeling
- Model comparison and performance tuning
- Class imbalance handling
- Dashboarding with Tableau for stakeholder communication

These are the same components used in building churn prediction systems, customer scoring models, and early-warning dashboards in product or business settings.
