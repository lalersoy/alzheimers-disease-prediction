# How This Project Applies to User Churn Prediction

This project used machine learning to classify the likelihood of Alzheimer's diagnosis. The same classification logic applies in digital product settings where the goal is to predict which users are at risk of churning (leaving or becoming inactive).

## Key Similarities

- **Binary Outcome:** Diagnosis (1) vs No diagnosis (0) is structurally identical to Churned (1) vs Retained (0).
- **Features:** 
  - Clinical tests → Product engagement metrics
  - Lifestyle/age → User demographics or usage behavior
- **Use Cases:**
  - Health: Early diagnosis and intervention
  - Product: Early churn detection and retention strategy

## Implementation Steps (Same in Both Domains)

1. Feature selection and cleaning
2. Model training and evaluation (LogReg, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
3. Handle class imbalance (e.g., with SMOTE)
4. Interpret model outputs (feature importance, dashboard)
5. Take action (targeted intervention or outreach)

By adapting the inputs to your user data, this pipeline becomes a **churn prediction engine**.
